# Drowsy driver

# Introduction

# High leval requirements
|HLR ID|Description|Implemented/Furure|
|------|-----------|------------------|
|HLR_1|When ever driver is drowsy, an alarm needs to be triggered|Future|
|HLR_2|When Vehicle catches fire, windows need to be opened automatically|Future|
|HLR_3|If driver consumes alcohol,vehicle has to be automatically stop|Future|
|HLR_4|A message has to be send to the driver relatives when any kind of accident happens|Waiting list|


# Low leval requirements
|LLR ID|Description|Implemented/Furure|
|------|-----------|------------------|
|LLR1_HLR_1|An eye blink sensor has to continuously monitor eye blinking|Future|
|LLR2_HLR_1|When eye blinking rate is high then alarm need to be triggered|Future|
|LLR2_HLR_1|An warning message has to be displayed on the LCD display|Future|
|LLR1_HLR_2|A fire sensor that connected to the microcontroller continiously moniter the temparature|Future|
|LLR2_HLR_2|The temparature sensor has to be connected to the window control.|Future|
|LLR3_HLR_2|When temparature is too high, it has to consider that fire present in vehicle and give input to the window control|Future|
|LLR4_HLR_2|After taking the input from fire sensor, windows control has to open the windows|Future|
|LLR5_HLR_2|A message has to send to relatives using gsm module|Waiting list|
|LLR1_HLR_3|A alcohol sensor conneted to the microcontroller continuosly moniter the alcohol presence in vehicle|Future|
|LLR2_HLR_3|If the alcohol is consumed by driver than it gives input to the ignition relay|Future|
|LLR3_HLR_3|Than ignition is off so the vehicle will be stoped automatically|Future|
|LLR1_HLR_4|Using GSM module a mesagge is send to relatives whem ant thing happens|Waiting list|
